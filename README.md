# Ben's Robotics Portfolio

Description of the bot

Our goal is to make a bot that can go really fast. We will use gear ratios and a transmission to achieve high speeds. It will also have rack and pinion steering and will have rear wheel drive. We decided to use a rectangular chasis for the most practicality.
