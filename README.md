# Ben's Robotics Portfolio

Description of the bot

Our goal is to make a bot that can go really fast. We will use gear ratios and a transmission to achieve high speeds. It will also have rack and pinion steering and will have rear wheel drive. We decided to use a rectangular chasis for the most practicality.

## Build
Slim, long rectangular build using gear ratios & a two gear transmission.

We will use a two gear transmission, first gear for torque and acceleration, second gear for maximum speed.

* 3-4 Motors
* ~15 Axels
